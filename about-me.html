												<h2>About me</h2>
											</header>


											<p>
                                                I was born in southern Mississippi in June 1993, but I have lived in many places and tried many different things. Out of the 7 states I've lived in, my most formative teen and young adult years were spent in Las Vegas, NV. I later moved to Tennessee to be closer to my nephews and that was where I met my lovely husband Bodhi.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In 2021, I was officially diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and this put a lot of my life experiences before and since into perspective. At the time I was working for Best Buy doing customer service over the phone, mainly in tech support and order management for home theater and appliances. I worked very hard to fit into the role I had, but learned over time that the way my brain is wired and the social expectations of front-line customer service did not gel together very well.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The other thing that job at Best Buy offered me, however, was a small taste of the tech world, which I decided to explore further. I started with a Google Coursera course in IT support fundamentals where I learned a lot that I didn't know before about basic computer science. Ultimately, I decided more general tech support wasn't going to be optimal for me, but I had always had a general curiosity towards coding. I downloaded a Python learning app called Mimo to play around with on my phone, and within a couple of weeks, started looking at bootcamps so I could learn more. I found, applied for, and was ultimately accepted to attend App Academy.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This really kickstarted my journey to becoming a software engineer. During my 24 weeks in the program, I built three full stack applications using a variety of tools including React, Redux, JavaScript, Python, Flask, Express, and more. Beyond that, I learned how to learn about tech, how to apply knowledge and skills I already had to new tools, how to read and understand documentation, and how to solve problems by breaking them down into more manageable pieces.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I'm currently living in southern IL and looking for a new position in software engineering to continue building this career. My favorite thing about coding is when I get absorbed in problem solving so deeply and everything else disappears. It's like solving puzzles or playing a game for me. Outside of coding I also love tattoos, all things Halloween or spooky, reading tarot, playing board/card/dice games, and D&D. I also spend time cuddling with my chihuahua/dachshund mixed dog, Daisy.
                                            </p>
